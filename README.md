## Attempted improvement of figure 1A, 1B from Pickrell et al. (2014)

Jow Pickrell's paper in PNAS got some attention on Reddit, where [a user complained about a plot](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/1yhqlp/ancient_west_eurasian_ancestry_in_southern_and/). Joe issued an open call for an improved version.

This is my attempt. I thought there were some things about the original plot that made it hard to read:

1. X-axis is simply the ranking of the y-axis. This violates the principle of all graphical elements having meaning. Better would be to have the x-axis show the actual population the value relates to.
2. Points are coloured by region and we have to refer to a legend to identify them. This violates the principle of least resistance to data context. We can minimise the friction of finding out what group the points are in by grouping them spatially
3. Joe points out that he wants to highlight that one group is lower. The original plot doesn't emphasise this very strongly. Better to distinguish the groups by both space and colour and sort them by median value.
